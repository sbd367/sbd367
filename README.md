# 👋 Hi, I’m Spencer
- 👀 I’m interested in creating and working on full-stack Node JS (web/chrome) applications using technologies such as (Express, mysql, Discord.js, React(Redux), Angular)... I've also had some time dabbleing in Ruby on Rails and Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more on working with Redux and dipping my toes in Tensorflow.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything until I have something to do.
- 📫 You can reach me via my email bergboost@gmail.com
